      Functional modules can be suggested by highly-connected network regions
      with similar responses to experimental conditions. These patterns can be
      detected visually, but in practice the high level of connectivity in
      interaction networks makes visual detection difficult. Putative modules
      can be identified with the jActiveModules plugin as follows. Further
      details are available in the original publication.

              the neighboring nodes of the module are also included. This aids
              in the identification of active modules in networks that contain
              nodes with many neighbors
              (<span style=FONT-STYLE:italic>i.e</span>., hubs). Consider a
              transcription factor with many targets: even if the transcription
              factor is not active, it is likely that some of it targets will be
              expressed simply due to random chance.&nbsp; Without regional
              scoring, this subset of targets can be selected as an active
              module, even though this arrangement is not unexpected. In this

        <li>
          <b>Search</b> - In this strategy, local, greedy searches are initiated
          from single nodes in the network.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <span style=FONT-WEIGHT:bold>Search Depth</span> - At each step in
            the greedy search, this parameter determines how close (as
            determined by shortest path) a node must be to the current active
            module to be considered for inclusion in the active module.<br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style=FONT-WEIGHT:bold>Max Depth</span> - This parameter
            determines how close a node must be to the initial seed node to be
            considered for inclusion in the active module.<br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style=FONT-WEIGHT:bold>Search from Selected Nodes</span> - By
            default, a separate search is initiated for each node in the
            network. Using this option, searches are only initiated from those
            nodes selected by the user.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <li>
          <b>Anneal</b> - In this strategy, all active modules in the network
          are discovered simultaneously. Nodes in the network can be turned "on"
          or "off." A connected set of "on" nodes form an active module. To
          avoid local optima, a simulated annealing approach is used to guide
          the global search. As opposed to the local greedy search, this
          algorithm is stochastic.<br>
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Annealing Parameters</b> - These parameters define the simulated
            annealing schedule. Over the specified number of
            <span style=FONT-WEIGHT:bold>iterations</span>, the temperature will
            be decreased from the <span style=FONT-WEIGHT:bold>starting
            temperature</span> to the <span style=FONT-WEIGHT:bold>ending
            temperature</span>.&nbsp; In a simulated annealing schedule, the
            temperature determines the likelihood of accepting low scoring
            modifications to the current solution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Annealing Extensions</b> - These are slight modifications to the
            simulated annealing search procedure.
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Quenching</b> - After the simulated annealing run is complete,
              a greedy search will be initiated from the final solution to
              ensure that a local optima has been reached.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Hubfinding</b> - In the simulated annealing algorithm, the
              presence of hubs often confuses the search process. Specifically,
              it is often difficult to turn hubs "on," as this tends to result
              in the creation of large, poor scoring modules. With "hubfinding,"
              the nodes surrounding a hub can be turned "off" when that hub is
              turned "on," preventing the formation of these very large
              clusters. This improves the detection of high scoring active
              modules.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <li>
            <b>Seed Graph Options</b> - This determines the initial state of the
            simulated annealing search. By fixing the value of the random seed,
            the results of the algorithm become deterministic.<br>

          z-score. Z-scores greater than 3.0 are generally considered
          significant. The table contains one column per expression experiment;
          for these columns, any row in which the cell is filled indicates a
          pathway that showed a significant response under the conditions of the
          experiment. Clicking on any row causes the corresponding nodes to be
